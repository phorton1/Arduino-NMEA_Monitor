# NMEA_Monitor 2025-05-06

Reworked to simplify in prep for E80 try.

- remove actisense
- remove telnet and wifi
- remove oled code

This "monitor" will simply work by outputting debugging to the
laptop via the main USB Serial port.

The 'old' documentation moved to /docs/old, and there is a copy
of the entire 'branch' at this point in /src/obs/Arduino/obs_NMEA_Monitor
